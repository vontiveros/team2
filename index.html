        <h1>China Censorship Project</h1>
       <p>Welcome to our project on Internet censorship in China. Our goal is to provide experts and novices alike with a better understanding of online censorship in the People's Republic of China by examining data on censored terms on WeChat provided by <a href='https://github.com/citizenlab'>Citizen Lab</a>.</p>.

       <p>The Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy, University of Toronto. More information can be found at their <a href='https://citizenlab.ca'>website</a>.</p>
