        <h2>Welcome</h2>
       <p>Welcome to our project on Internet censorship in China. Our goal is to provide experts and novices alike with a better understanding of online censorship in the People's Republic of China by examining data on censored terms on WeChat provided by the <a href='https://github.com/citizenlab'>Citizen Lab</a>.</p>
       <p>The Citizen Lab is an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy, University of Toronto. More information can be find at their <a href="https://citizenlab.ca">website</a>.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>It is common knowledge that China’s ‘Great Firewall’ blocks many Western companies from reaching users in Mainland China. For example, the New York Times, BBC, Washington Post, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Instagram are all inaccessible from within Mainland China without a virtual private network (VPN), which are also illegal in Mainland China. However, many people outside of China are unaware that Chinese internet and social media apps are also subject to intensive government oversight. In WeChat, the Chinese government censors sensitive key words, phrases, and images sent by users through the app. 

      The Citizen Lab tested some known censored topics by sending a sensitive message from a Canada based WeChat account to a Mainland China based account. They found that messages containing sensitive topics sent from one account were not received by the other account.
